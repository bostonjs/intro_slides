# BostonJS Meetup Intro Slides

This is a [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) slide deck set to auto-advance and loop.

**Slides may be viewed at [bostonjs.github.io/intro_slides](https://bostonjs.github.io/intro_slides)**

Before each meetup, edit the content in [slides.md](slides.md) to reflect the latest speakers & sponsors.

Always push the latest slides to the `gh-pages` branch.

Slides are edited using [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). `---` is used in the slides markdown file to separate the individual slides.
